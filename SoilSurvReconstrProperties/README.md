# SoilSurvReconstrProperties: Soil Survey Reconstructed Soil Property Maps
Documentation of project recreating soil property maps from conventional soil survey using predictive soil mapping techniques for the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB). Project is in Beta status with peer review pending.

This software is preliminary or provisional and is subject to revision. It is being provided to meet the need for timely best science. The software has not received final approval by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

Repository for article: Nauman, T.W, Duniway, M.C.. In Review. A hybrid approach for predictive soil property mapping using conventional soil survey data. Submitted to: Soil Science Society of America Journal.

This repository documents code and data inputs used to create new soil property maps of the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) using past soil survey field observations to recreate maps of specific soil properties at standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100, and 200 cm). Files are organized by soil property except materials that summarize all models.

Files in this folder:

PerformanceSummarybyModel_repository.xlsx: Table summarizing performance metrics for all models.

Separate Data repositories store the maps associated with the project and are located at the links below. Additional high resolution 1:1 accuracy plots are also available at these beta version repositories.
